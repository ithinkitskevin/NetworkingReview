Networking Issues
Networks in two ways
Wired
Wireless
They can be combined, as most businesses

Through Media
Copper cables - Cables can become worn out/damaged
    -This si when shortage can happen
Make sure to have the right kind of cable to correlate environment (Fans, air conditioner, and more can mess with the attenuation (signal))
Media (Length of the cable)
    - Maximum length of a cable
    - Using right type of the network

Wireless Factors
Antenna Type
Omni Directional Antenna 
    - Devices can get the signal from any director the antenna is facing
Directional Antenna
    - Wherever you point, the signal is sent

Interference - Microwave oven/wireless devices can interfere signals.
    - You can change the channel or something. Depends on what, like buildings. wireless phones and more.

Wrong Encryption
    - Using WPA2 on your router to a computer that's only compatible to computers who can only handel WPA 

DHCP Server was removed, then computers with expired IP address will have no server to send their IP Address Request
    - Also affect when a new computers are added
This is the only case if IP address are automatically. It would have no affect if IP address are configured statically

If another DHCP server is added, then we need to mkae sure that all IP address are unique. So configure the IP Address Pool correctly

DNS probelms can happen also

Link LEDS (Light Emitting Diode)
    - Simple indicators that are able to tell us information on network devices
    - Green Led - AKA Link Light - Tells us ssuccessful Network connection
        - If green led is off, then something bad has happened
    - Yellow Led - Activity Light, indicates network activity
