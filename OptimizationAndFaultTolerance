Optimization & Fault Tolerance
Bandwidth Sharper - Used to control Network Traffic
    - control upload/download rate to some activites, like recreational needs rate's upload and download can be low while rate for anything work-related can be high

Traffic Shaping - Same as Bandwidth Sharper
    - Prioritizes Applications and guaranteses bandwidth for more important services

Load Balancer 
    - Hardware/Software to evenly distribute data activity across network so no servers/compuers become overwhelmed.
        So if a server is becoming overwhelmed, then we can get a load balancer so that both servers have balanced network activity

QoS - Quality of Service
    - Term used to provide guarantee of data deliver within a certain period of time

Port Blocking
    - Done on a firewall for a bit more security
    - As Net Admin, you can control which ports are open/close

High Availability - Term used to guarantee a period of uptime for continual operation

Power - Fault Tolerance
    - Power outage can cause some devices to shut off. So you'll need a device like a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply)
    UPS - Protects agains surges/spikes as well

Link Redundancy
    - Having continous connection to network in event of failure
    - Have ISDN line as a backup
    - Have primary/secondary NIC

Backup Services
    - Standby server is secondary server with exact configureation as the primary
        - So if primary server fails, then the standby server will take over
    - Server CLustering - Groups of servers working together for load balancing and fault tolerance
        - Works best when servers are in different geographical location - So if an earthquake destroys a server, then the other servers will be alright

Disaster Recovery 
    - Fault Tolerance - Defined as prevention of data loss if network component fails
        - But what would happen when fault tolerance fails?
    - Disaster Recovery is the process of rebuilding an oranizations after data is lost

Three Types of Backups
Full - Full backup is when data is backed up in one tape.
    - But what if there's alot of data? It would take forever to finish backing up!
Incremental - Includes all data that has been changed since the last full or incremental backup
    - So day by day, backup can happen for that weekday as an example. Archive bit - The way incremental data backup knows which data has been changed
So to restore in a incremental backup, you'll first have to restore the full backup (that might have happened on a weekend) then the incremental backup (in correct order)
Differential - Data that has backed up since the last full backup
So an example, a full backup happens on weekend. Cool. So now on Monday, there will be a backup. THen tuesday backup will include backup from both monday and tuesday. THen wednesday backup will have both monday, tuesday and wednesday. And so on.
Differential backup does not clear archive bit
Full backup + last differential backup will restore everything

Offsite storage - storage located in different location

Hot spares - Equipment that can be swapped out without need of turning off the power

Cold Spares - Equpiment that has to be turned off before sqapping out any equipments
