Network Utilities
Ping - Yeah... Used to name resolution/network connectivity
Request Timed Out - Host is down/firewall is blocking ping requests
Destination Host Unreachable - Coming from the router, the route to the destination is not found
Test DNS (Domain Name System)

Pathping - Combines functionality of ping/tracert
This will give the data path (tracert) as well as ping (ping)

ARP Ping - Firewall blocking all ping request
Uses ARP Data packets, so FIREWALL will NOT block any ping request on LAN
So ARP ping will not work through the internet

tracert - traceroute
    -Used to note the exact path the data packet has taken
It can isolate problems between routers

Nbtstat utility - used to resolve netbios names to IP address
    - Least used

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
    - Used to resolve IP address to MAC addresses
First, it'll check ARP cache
    -You can check by arp -s
THen it'll ask the corresponding IP address so that it can find the MAC address, and it'll store it in the ARP cache

Netstat - Used to tell current network connections
    - also tells which ports are opened

Ipconfig - Network configuration
(btw this is for command prompt...)
ipconfig /all
    -Displays full TCP/IP configuration
ipconfig /renew
    -Releases/renew IP address lease
ipconfig /release
    -Releases the IP address lease

ifconfig - Done in unix/linux 
    -Displays info from network interface card
        ex) IP addres, Subnet mask, packets received/sent, any errors
    - Can also be linked with switches

Nslookup/dig
    - Looks up DNS information
