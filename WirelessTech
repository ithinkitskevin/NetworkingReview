Wireless Technologies
802.11 - Wireless Standard - There are 5 Wireless Standards.
Before lookin at these, let's look at the differences between 2.4 GHZ vs 5 Ghz
2.4 Ghz supports 450 to 600 Mbps, but 5 Ghz supports up to 1300 Mbps. That's great! So why doesn't everyone use 5 Ghz? Because due to the density of 5 Ghz, it is less able to penetrate walls and solid objects. So it's commonly used for shorter distance while 2.4 Ghz is used for longer distance. BUT WAIT, every devices seems to be using this frequency, like cordless phones, baby monitors, and so much more.
802.11a - 54 Mbps - 5 Ghz - Released 1999
802.11b - 11 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - Released 1999
802.11g - 54 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - Released 2003
802.11n - 600 Mbps (wow) - 2.4 Ghz OR 5 Ghz - Released 2009 (alot of improvements)
802.11ac - 6933 Mbps (exponential increase) - 5 Ghz - Released 2014
Dual Band vs Tri Band 
Dual Band is having both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz.
Tri Band is having one 2Ghz (speed upto 600Mbps) AND 5 Ghz  (speed up to 1300Mbps) 
Infrared - Wireless tech that allows data to be transmitted through rays of light. It requires direct line of sight. Alot of stuff blocks infrared light, like any solid object. Infrared also doesn't work in direct sunlight. 
Bluetooth - Short range radio - Data transmit as well - Operates at 2.4 Ghz (remember what I just said?)
