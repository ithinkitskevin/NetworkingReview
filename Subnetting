Subnetting
Making a Network and dividing it up to a smaller networks (subnets) to make it more manageable. 
Changing the default subnet mask by borrowing bits designated for host.
Ex) Class B IP Address: 173.16.0.0
    Class B Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
Let's say that we need at least three subnets. So we'll use a equation 2^n-2 to try and get how many number of bits we're replacing in the host section of the class B. So... Let's begin with n=2. pluggin 2^2 - 2, we get 2 Subnet. But we need at least three subnet, so we can't do that. Now let's try n = 3. 2^3-2 = 6 Subnet. Since six is greater than three, we'll replace the three bits from the host portion of subnet mask to break up our network. So let's try to get our new subnet mask by first looking at our default subnet mask. Our default subet mask is 255.255.0.0, which is 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 in Binary. We'll get rid of the 3 bits from the host portion, thus getting 11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000, and this in decimal will be 255.255.224.0, which is our new subnet mask. This will give us about 8000 host. Wait, how did you get 8000 (the video said so... but let's go more in depth)? We'll look at the host section of the subnet mask. 11100000.00000000. There are three ones in the host section, which means 2^3 = 8 Usuable Subnets Created. Alright, cool. But there are 13 ZZeros. So the number of hosts per subnet will be calculated using 2^n = 2^13 = 8192
