Mac Address
Media Access Control (AKA Physical Address)
Used to uniquely identiy each device on the network
Six byte Hexadecimal Number (xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx) butrned into every NIC
Contains 0-9 A-F... You know, cause it's hexadecimal...
Broken up into two parts. 
The first three bytes (00-00-00-xx-xx-xx)
    Identifies the manufacturer of the NIC
Last three bytes (xx-xx-xx-00-00-00)
    Uniquely identifies each devices
That's it... I mean, on the side note, MAC addresses are used in the Media Access Control (guess why) sublayer in the OSI model. It is also very easy to "imitate" MAC addresses, macchanger
