Routing Protocols
Collect information about the current network status and map out best path for data packets to take to their specific destniation.

Loopback Interface - Fake or Virtual interface created on a router. It's not real, but it is assigned an IP address of your (choosing). This protocol is used for testing/administration purposes only. 

Routing Table - File that contains set of rules that shows information on what data packet takes to its destination
-Forwards the data packet along the best path to its destination
A basic routing table contains
    Network Destination: The IP address of the final destination
    Subsnet Mask: Determines what part of the IP address is the host or network portion
    Gateway: Tells the router which private IP address the data packet should be forwarded to
    Interface: Outgoing IP address of the sending device
    Next Hop: Ip address to which IP address is forwarded to
    Metric: Determines the best route among multiple destinations

Going back to routing protocols, there are three different types of routing protocols. 
Distance Vector- Factors in distance based on how many hops (which is how many routers it takes). 
    RIP V1.0 - Routing Information Protocol (old)
        -Routers that uses RIP will broadcast their routing information to every other routers evert 30 seconds, regardless of changes in routing information
        -But RIP V1.0 created alot of unneccessary traffic.
    RIP V2.0 - This version of RIP was used to solve problems of broadcast traffic
    BGP - Border Gateway Protocol - Standard routing protocol
        - This is based on Paths and policies
Link State - Used by routed to share information, in which the best path on a network is independently mapped out
    OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
        -Routing protocol used to determine the correct route for data pacekts to take to their destination. Collects information from other routers using IP and creates a topology of the map
    IS-IS - Intermediate System to Intermediate System
        -Routers are organized into a domain/groups
        -Functions within these domains
        -Uses CLNS (ConnectionLess Network Service) to communicate to other routers

Hybrid - Combination of Distance Vector and Link State Protocols
    EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
        Only runs on Cisco Routers
        -Fast, les overhead, and supports many network layer protocols

SIP - Session Initiation Protocol
    - Establishes Communcation sessions over the internet
    VoiP - (Voice over internet Protocol)
        - Term that is used for voice communications over IP networks
        - Used for Instant Messaging/Conferencing Services
        -Operates at the Application Layer

RTP - Real-Time Transport Protocol 
    - Internet standard for transporting real-time data like streaming audio/video
    Used over UDP (doesn't guarantee data delivery) and RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol - Enables you to monitor the quality of data being delivered)
    - Send both unicast/multicast
