Networking Tools & Safety
Wire Crimper Tool - Used to crimp connectors to cables
    -Used to make custom length
Punch Down Tool - Punches down wires to a punch-down block
Punch Down block - Electrical connection, usually used in telephony
Media Tester -  Used to test networking cables so that they're wired correctly. 
    - Connect both ends of the cable to this testing machine and it'll say if it works
Cable Stripper - To get rid of the plastic surrounding of a cable, so that it can be crimped
TDR - Time-Domain Reflector
    -Used to test cables, suchas unshielded twisted pair/coaxial cable
    -Transmits signal through the cable and the signal ir reflected back
    -Pinpoints any problems like Conductors, loose connectors, shorts, crimps, bends and more
OTDR - Optical Time-Domain Reflector
    -Same thing as TDR, but for Optical FIber
    -Transmits light
Multimeter - measures electricity
    -Comes in analog/digital
Butt Set - Resembles a telephone
    - Test/monitors telephone line
    - Hears into conversation
Voltage Event Recorder - Device used to collect data about quality of electrical power
    - Comes with software
Tone Generator 
    -Used to isolate cables Locates cables one end to another
    - if you suspect a bad wire from a group, you'll insert one end of a tone generator to the bad wire and detect it using the tone sensor
Protocol Analyzer - Packet Sniffer ;D
Software/Hardware tool used to troubleshoot/analyze traffic on network
    -like logs, data packets, broadcasts
    -detects network problems, intrusion attems, and monitors networking issues
    ex) Wireshark
Antivirus software - Detects viruses on computer and gets rid of it
ESD - Electrostatic Discharge - A damage...
    -Happens when you shock a computer part. A sudden charge will hurt your computer component
    -Make sure to wear ESD Wrist Strap
    -Or work on a ESD mat, which will remove any electrical charge
MSDS - Material Safety Data Sheet
    - Computer can contain lead/mercury that will be harmful to environment

SAFETY TIPS
Always make sure to turn off power/unplug power cable
Remove hand jewerly, as they can conduct electricity
Take note where fire extinguisher and use it when fire happens (Class 'C' Fire Extinguisher)
