Troubleshooting Strategy
1. Identify Symptoms/potential causes
    -Gather info about problem
    - What's the problem/ when problem occur/ what the problem is/ error message/ Does the problem happen all the time/intermittenly
    - Get all the information of the broblems
2. Identify affected area
    - Is the problem isolated/spread accross several locatoin
    - is the problem affects everyone
        - So check switch
    - If problem is isolated
        - Check individual cable
3. Establish what has changed
    - Problem doesn't change randonly
        So, examples are... Did anything change just prior to the problems happening, was any hardware added/removed, software installed/uninstalled, anything downloaded from the internet
4. Select the most plausible cause
    - Look for simple solutions first, does the device have power, cables plugged in, check the LEDs
5. Implement an action plan/solutions including potential effects
    -THE MOST CAUTIOUS PHASE
    - Must know what effect the action will have on the network/ will it affect entire network or isolated at one area
6. Test the Result
    - Take actions to solve the problem
    - Where you willl know if your plan of action will truly solve the problem or not
7. Has your plan of action solved the problem or not. 
    - What effect did it have on everyone else?
    - Do the results show temporary fix/permanent one
8. Document solution/process
    - document the problems/solutions.
