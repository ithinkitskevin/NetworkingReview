WAN technologies
Packet - Data is divided into small data packets and sent
Two types of ways packets are sent
Packet Switching - Data packets take different routes to the destination, and when they are all in the destination, they are grouped back (connectionless)
Circuit Switching - Sends data packets differently, but in the same dedicated route. Like telephone lines.

ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network
    - Significant speed improvement of speed, compared to 56 Kbps modem.
    - Standard for digital transmission over ordinary telephone line
    - ISDN sends data over 128 Kbps
Never caught on due to DSL/Cable

T1 Line - T Carrier Level 1 - Commonly used internet service for Businesses today
    - 1.544 Mbps - consists of 24 inidividual channes with 64 Kbps each
    - Each cable can contain data/voice

T3 Line - T Carrier Level 3 - High speed
    - Speed is 43 Mbps
    - consists of 672 individual channels with 64 Kbps each
    - Mainly used by ISPs that connects directly to the backbone of the internet

E1 Line - Format used in Europe 
    - 2 Mbps - 32 channels of 64 Kbps

E3 Line - Format used in Europe (like T3)
    - 34 Mbps - Fewer channels

OCx - Optical Carrier
    - Describes the speed of networks through SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)
    - It's a fiber-optic tech that can deliver voice, data, video at high speeds
    - OC levels are at 51.84 Mbps

Levels of OC Level (you can get the speed by multiply it my 51.84)
OC-1
OC-3 - 155.52 Mbps
OC-12 - 622.08 Mbps
OC-24 - 1.244 Gbps
OC-48 so on
OC-192
