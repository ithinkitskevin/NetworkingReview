Authentication Protocols
In computers, authentication is a process of identifying users. There are several protocols to achieve authentication. 
PAP - Password Authentication Protocol
    -Very basic and useful. BUT NOT SAFE. ALL LOGIN AND PASSWORD IS NOT ENCRYPTED

CHAP - Challenge Hackshake Protocol
    - Just like PAP, but it encrypts usernames/passwords
    - Client validation done thorugh 3 way handshake
STEPS:
0. Connection Made
1. Server asks client to has the password for certain username
2. One-way hashed password is sent back and the server checks the password.

MS-CHAP - Microsoft's version of Chap
TWO TYPES
MS-CHAP - Basically CHAP
MS-CHAP 2 - Both client/server are authenticated

Radius - Remote Authentication Dial-In Service
Enables a single server to handle all authentication
Radius server makes request on the user's behalf after authentication
Contains user access data in centralized location

Kerberos Authentication
    -Authenticates by using tickets
    -After authentication, a client is given a ticket from the Kerberos Server. Thus, the client would get access to network resources

EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol 
    -Extensions to PPP
    -Supports many methods of authentication
    -Commonly associated with Smart Cards
