Security Protocols
IPSec - Internet Protocol Security
    - Works at the network layer to encrypt data when communication is happening. Both sender/receiver must share the same key, as the public key lock/unlocks data. This is to prevent data tampering. Verifys that data is received as exactly as what it was sent
Has two mode
Tranport Mode - Message portion is encrypted
Tunnel Mode - Entire packet is encrypted

L2TP - Layer 2 Tunneling protocol
    - Combination of Cisco's Layer 2 forwarding/PPTP
    - Authenticates both computer/user
        This is to prevent Man in the Middle attack

SSL - Secure Sockets Layer
Protocol that proves security on the internet
https://
Provides security in three ways
1. Authenticates the server
2. Authenticates the client
3. Encrypts the data

TLS - Transport Layer Security
Successor to SSL
Authenticates the server/client and encrypts the data
But it's also made up of 2 layers
TLS Record Protocol - Provides connection security by making sure connection is private/reliable
TLS Handshake Protocol - Allows server/client to authenticate each other and negotiates encryption algorithm/cryptographic key before sending data
- Goal is to make sure SSL is more secure

802.1x - Used for both wired/wirelesss networks
Controls network access by ports
It's a port based authentication that will close if authentication fails, but opens if authentication is verified
