VLAN, Intranet & Extranet
VLANS - Virtualized Local Area Network
    -Controls network traffic regardless of physicalities of the locations
        - By installing a virtual switch, we can seperate networks and seperate network broadcast traffic
    -This can also happen by ports (by Vlan switch) or by the MAC address of computers

Intranet - Private network belongs to an organization
    -Behind a firewall so no one outside can access it

Extranet - Private network that can be accessible from outside based on restriction
    - Company A can access Company B
